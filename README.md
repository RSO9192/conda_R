# Tutorial on using conda and R

## Brief introduction
If you are an R user, it is possible that you simply installed R and RStudio in default locations. However, when you need to use specific version of R or some libraries require specific versions of R to be installed, then you need to understand environments. 

## Why using conda/mamba

The idea is that you can create [conda environments](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) in which you can install all your programmes (e.g R). These programmes now exists inside your environment only. This means you can have multiple environments in your computer, with different versions of R installed, for example. This has several benefits, including the fact that you can share your environment with other people avoiding dependencies issues. 

Mamba is a faster version of conda. 

## Practice

The first thing is installing [mamba](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge). After mamba is successfully installed, you can create your first environment!
