# Tutorial on using conda and R

## Brief introduction
If you are an R user, it is possible that you simply installed R and RStudio in default location. However, when you need to use specific version of R or some libraries require specific veersions of R to be installed, then you need to understand environments. 

## Why using conda/mamba

The idea is that you can create [conda environments](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) in which you can install all your programmes (e.g R) which exsist only inside your environment. This means you can have multiple environments, with different version of R installed, for example. This has several benefits, including the fact that you can share your environment with other people avoiding dependencies issues.
